# **Week 0 — Billing and Architecture**

# What I know already?

Before starting my cloud project, I’m gonna remind myself of what useful knowledge do I already have.

As a student of Software Engineering, I have the essential knowledge of software lifecycle such as Requirements, Analysis, Design, Development, Deployment and Testing. I have played with different programming languages that includes C, Java and Python. Will start C# in the next semester during the course of Game Development.

I have been focusing on the development side for quite a while in Javascript.

- Designing a webpage using HTML and CSS.
- Using CSS libraries such as Bootstrap and TailwindCSS.
- Using React for building Single Page Applications that use Components library such as MUI.
- Using Express in Node JS server to create an API that fetches data from MongoDB.

Still, I haven’t been able to get a job and haven’t been doing anything in the development side as a job.

I am a student of Cloud Computing course, and this is what I have been taught in there:

- Linux Essentials
- Docker Containerization
- Kubernetes Basics

# Preparation for the Cloud Project

- I have a github Account.
- Registered an AWS account.
- Registered a LucidChart account.
- Read the Course Outline.
- Missing out a little in prerequiste as I have zero knowledge of AWS.
